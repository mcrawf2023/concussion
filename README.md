This is my final project for my Machine Learning class at the University of Notre Dame in the programming language R. I used the dataset 'Depression & Concussion-Like Symptoms in Adolescent Athletes in the Absence of Recent Injury' from Harvard University in order to examine trends in lingering post-concussive symptoms. The goal of my project is to utilize unsupervised learning, specifically clustering methods, to identify patterns in data and to segment subgroups of patients based on similar symptoms, severity of symptoms, and demographics.
