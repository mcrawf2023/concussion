I utilized unsupervised learning techniques in R to analyze the dataset 'Depression & Concussion-Like Symptoms in Adolescent Athletes in the Absence of Recent Injury' from Harvard University in order to examine trends in lingering post-concussive symptoms. In this project, I implemented hierarchical and k-means clustering to distinguish subgroups of patients and ultimately identified a cluster characterized by patients with a concussion history where many of the athletes highly ranked symptoms relating to lack of sleep, increased sadness, and difficulty concentrating. I examined the quality of the k-means clusters by plotting the cluster cardinality (the number of samples in each cluster) against the cluster magnitude (sum of squares within each cluster) and looked for the clusters that exhibited a positive correlation between cardinality and magnitude.
