In this project, I utilized unsupervised learning techniques in R to analyze the dataset 'Depression & Concussion-Like Symptoms in Adolescent Athletes in the Absence of Recent Injury' from Harvard University in order to examine trends in lingering post-concussive symptoms. I implemented hierarchical and k-means clustering which allowed me to find patterns in the samples and segment similar subgroups of patients based on common symptoms and medical histories. Cluster 2 of the third round of k-means clustering was characterized by patients who have a concussion history and have experienced 1-2 concussions. Further, many of the patients in this cluster ranked symptoms related to lack of sleep and increasing sadness highly, indicating that these could be lingering symptoms and long-term effects of concussions. I examined the quality of the k-means clusters by plotting the cluster cardinality (the number of samples in each cluster) against the cluster magnitude (sum of squares within each cluster) and looked for the clusters that exhibited a positive correlation between cardinality and magnitude.
